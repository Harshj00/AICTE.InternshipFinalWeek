# 🌍 Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting greenhouse gas emissions using historical environmental and industrial data. Developed during my internship, the goal was to build a machine learning pipeline that helps in forecasting future emissions, aiding in climate change analysis and sustainability planning.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔮 **Objective**: Predict future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on historical data.
- 🧠 **Approach**: Implement machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and others to identify trends and patterns in GHG data.
- 📊 **Outcome**: Provide an interpretable and accurate model for forecasting emissions, with visualizations for insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Obtained datasets from publicly available climate sources.
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaned and prepared data for modeling (handled missing values, encoding, scaling).
3. **EDA** – Analyzed trends and correlations between features and emissions.
4. **Model Training** – Trained various regression models to predict emissions.
5. **Evaluation** – Compared models using MAE, RMSE, and R² score.
6. **Visualization** – Plotted actual vs predicted emissions for interpretability.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Multiple regression models for performance comparison.
- Reproducible pipeline from preprocessing to prediction.
- Visual analytics for emission trends and forecasts.

## 📊 Sample Results

> *Random Forest Regressor achieved an R² score of **0.91** on test data, showing strong predictive performance.*

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add deep learning models (e.g., LSTM for time-series forecasting).
- Incorporate real-time emission data sources.
- Build an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Flask.
